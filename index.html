<p>Rock climbing is more than just a sport. It is a way for us to overcome fears,<br>
strengthen our bodies and minds, discover spectacular places around the 
world, and interact with human beings from all walks of life. It can be 
humbling when discover your initial limitations, but also so much more 
empowering when you  discover how you and your body are capable of 
overcoming them. All these aspects combine to create a pursuit that is 
addicting and often life changing.</p>

<p>On the north coast of Taiwan is Long Dong, one of the world's most 
spectacular sandstone sea-cliff climbing areas. There are hundreds of routes 
for all skill and interest levels, ranging from short routes of pure movement to
full-on one day adventures. The area is about 90 minutes from Taipei by bus
and has several small shops selling snacks, water, and beer. </p>

<p>"Climbing is a game in which we play at learning the skills necessary to a 
beautiful life" -Royal Robbins, Yosemite climbing legend. </p>

<p>Whether you've traveled around the world in search of beautiful rock or never 
before worn climbing shoes, our programs will inspire a connection with a 
magical and powerful art form in a truly awesome part of the world. </p>

climbs can be done by placing protection instead of using the drilled bolts. 
We offer courses for those who have never placed gear, advanced technique, 
as well as day or multi-day guiding. </p>

<p>Courses included: Traditional Gear Placement, Leading Traditional Climbs, 
Traditional Climbing Practice, Traditional Gear Anchors</p>

<h2>Your Guides</h2>

<p>Ming has dedicated a large portion of his life to climbing since returning to 
Taiwan ten years ago. He has spent almost every weekend at Long Dong or 
scouting new areas around the island.  During that time he was mentored 
intensely in attaching himself to the rock with the aid of traditional gear, how 
to climb safely (i.e. how and when to chicken out), and most importantly how 
to drink copious amounts of alcohol at the end of a climbing day to celebrate 
still being alive. He learned these difficult and subtle crafts by some of the 
finest local and international climbers ever to visit Long Dong. Now he feels 
ready to share this knowledge and the life-changing experience of climbing at 
Long Dong.  </p>

<p>Ana began her climbing addiction in Yangshuo, China -Asia's largest sport 
climbing area. As the addiction set in, she abandoned a conventional career 
on a quest to learn as much as possible from the legends around her. She 
worked as a guide leading school groups and individuals on caving, climbing, 
and kayaking adventures. She came to Taiwan after hearing rumors of the 
glorious sea stacks and has made it her mission to spend as much time as 
possible at Long Dong or exploring Taiwan's other climbing potential. Since 
being in Taiwan, she has been seen ascending many a classic LD route 
seemingly effortlessly.</p>

figure 8 knot, and how to belay a top-roped climber. Basic movement 
technique over vertical terrain will also be demonstrated. Students will have 
the opportunity to complete 2 top-rope climbs. Since this course is presented 
in an artificial environment, students are encouraged to seek out additional 
instruction in order to climb in a natural environment, such as the courses 
offered below.  </p>

<p>Course Topics: Risk Management. Tying in. Top-rope Belay. Movement 
Technique.</p>

<p>Duration: Approximately 2 hrs.</p>

vertical environment such as how to negotiate different types of terrain from 
low-angle slab to steep overhangs and roofs, how to use different handholds 
such as sidepulls, underclings, crimps, slopers, pinches, pockets, how to 
use their feet well, i.e smearing, edging, stemming, matching, hooking and 
flagging.  Students will then be presented with a variety of routes to challenge 
their movement ability, completing a minimum of two top-rope climbs or a set 
of 5 problems.</p>

<p>Course Topics: Negotiating various types of terrain. Advanced Foot 
Technique. Various Handholds.</p>

<p>Duration: 1 hr.</p>

<p>Location: Fuhe Bridge Tower, Nangang Sports Center or GongGuan

be an autonomous and responsible climber. Students will learn how to 
identify generals hazards of leading, how to assess risk while on lead, how to 
set up a stance for clipping, and proper clipping technique.Sometimes leaders 
must lead from behind as well, so the essentials of lead belaying will be 
covered. Students will then have the opportunity to lead 2 climbs and belay at 
least 1 lead climb to integrate all the skills necessary to be a good leader. 
Students completing this course or who have the equivalent experience are 
still strongly encouraged to take Lead Climbing (Natural Rock) before they 
attempt to lead outside.</p>
