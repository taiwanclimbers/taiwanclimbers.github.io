It is a way for us to overcome fears, \r\nstrengthen our bodies and minds, discover spectacular places around the \r\nworld, and interact with human beings from all walks of life. It can be \r\nhumbling when you discover your initial limitations, but also empowering when \r\nyou discover how you and your body are capable of going beyond them. All these \r\naspects combine to create a pursuit that is addicting and often life changing.\r\n\r\nOn the north coast of Taiwan is Long Dong, one of the world's most \r\nspectacular sandstone sea-cliff climbing areas. There are are over five hundred \r\nroutes for all skill and interest levels, ranging from short routes of pure \r\nmovement to full-on one day adventures. The area is about 90 minutes from \r\nTaipei by bus and is near the small fishing village of Hemei. \r\n\r\n\"Climbing is a game in which we play at learning the skills necessary to a \r\nbeautiful life\" -Royal Robbins, Yosemite climbing legend. \r\n\r\nWhether you've traveled around the world in search of beautiful rock or never \r\nbefore worn climbing shoes, our programs will inspire a connection with a \r\nmagical and powerful art form in a truly awesome part of the world. \r\n\r\n## Climbing Packages\r\n\r\n### For Beginning Climbers \r\n\r\nIndoor Package: This is a tour of what climbing is all about.

He has spent nearly every weekend at Long Dong or \r\nscouting for new areas around the island.  During that time he was mentored \r\nintensely by some of the finest local and international climbers ever to visit \r\nTaiwan. He learned such difficult and subtle crafts as the use of traditional \r\ngear, how to climb safely (i.e. how and when to chicken out), and how to drink \r\ncopious amounts of alcohol at the end of a climbing day to celebrate still \r\nbeing alive.  Now he feels ready to share this knowledge and the life-changing \r\nexperience of climbing at Long Dong.  \r\n\r\nAna began her climbing addiction in Yangshuo, China -Asia's largest sport \r\nclimbing area. As the addiction set in, she abandoned a conventional career \r\non a quest to learn as much as possible from the legends around her. She has\r\nworked as a guide leading school groups and individuals on caving, climbing, \r\nand kayaking adventures. She came to Taiwan after hearing rumors of the \r\nglorious sea stacks and has made it her mission to spend as much time as \r\npossible at Long Dong or exploring Taiwan's other climbing potential. Since \r\nbeing in Taiwan, she has been seen ascending many a classic LD route \r\nseemingly effortlessly.\r\n   \r\n# Course Catalog\r\n\r\n### Introduction to Climbing (Artificial Wall)\r\n\r\nDescription: This is a first course in climbing.
